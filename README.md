# 3DStylus - 3D Pointer and Simple Stroke Recognition (ongoing)

## Overview

This repository hosts a C++ application for 3D Pointer and Simple Stroke Recognition using depth cameras.

## Features

- **Hand Isolation:** Efficiently isolates hands in image sequences.
- **Pointer Location:** Computes pointer location in the depth-image space.
- **Stroke Classification:** Classifies strokes based on pointer positions.

## Implementation

The application uses the $1 Unistroke Recognizer.

## Key Details

- **Camera Support:** Adaptable to data from different models of depth cameras.
- **Gesture Handling:** Accommodates diverse scenarios, including gestures with two hands.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Submit pull requests, report issues, or suggest improvements.

Thanks for exploring the 3D Pointer and Simple Stroke Recognition project. Happy coding!
